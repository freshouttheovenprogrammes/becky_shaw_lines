    Is your boi coding? No worries, I gotchu. I am your computer
    Here are the different commands I can take. All commands are case insensitive
      If you want to choose a scene, always type Scene #
      If at anytime you would like a hint, type Hint. Be warned as I do keep track of how many hints you use. See how few you can get each run!
      The hint feature currently doesn't work if you ask me for a hint on first line. Sorry!
      You can type Main Menu at any time to return to the main menu
      Type Exit at any time to quit the program
